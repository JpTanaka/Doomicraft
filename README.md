# ‚õèÔ∏è Doomicraft ‚õèÔ∏è

A mix between Minecraft and Doom! Build your world on Creative or fight creepers in Survival, hoping to last another level...

Made on C++ with the CGP library (built on top of OpenGL) as an learning experiment with graphics programing.

The game is free to play and it uses free assets. 

Originally a project for the INF443 course at Polytechnique.
